Page for defining character rotations
Page for storing all disc drives you own
Page for showing DPS based on:

Agent
Weapon
Disc drive
...Skill levels??? (Stretch goal)

BUFFS. - e.g. Nicole gives +15% CR. This needs to be addable
to the current character (e.g. Zhu Yuan) as a pill.
 - It could be custom buffs - select CR and +15%
 - Or it could be auto-buffs based on team member

Page for showing team comp for each agent. 
Or a team builder page...? This one gets REALLY hard. 
The whole concept so far relies on focusing on one agent.
